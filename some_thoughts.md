So here will be another ðŸ§µwhere I will compile some thoughts and tweets I posted before. Especially since it's 1 day since anyone tried to silence, gaslight and dismiss my voice. And I kinda miss seeing people mass unfollowing me. 

It will consist of a few parts.

1. people who donated for dog pfp are not immune or 100% right. It doesn't mean they can't have shitty opinions/beliefs, or just being an asshole. And it can be easy hijacked by anyone who donated to promote any kind of propaganda.

2. Subtle propaganda. It exist. And much harder to spot (especially if you have small experience). And it does not exist to present the totally opposite side, but slowly erode positions and dissolve edges. After which your attention can be manipulated and diverted.

That's why it's generally hard to call out seemingly supportive people who once in a while publish absolutely unacceptable takes. Especially if that is being presented as supportive and pro.

3. False equivalence between supporters and people directly involved. If people (victims of genocide) are raising concerns - you shouldn't silence them under pretext that's it infighting, emotional, etc. Well, you can, but then don't call yourself a supporter.

"You shouldn't say something because it's infighting" is silencing bullshit as a result of which we have certain part of so-called "fellas" openly harassing Ukrainians and part of people who not agree just silently watching just because that's "infighting" and "drama".

It's also connecting to situations when someone with a dog pfp harasses Ukrainian and people don't want to admit that's bad because you are part of NAFO - congratulations. That's refusal. Refusal to take responsibility for being a part of something and looking away.

4. If someone puts a Ukrainian flag on their profile name - doesn't automatically mean they are indeed supporting. Same as if someone did something good means that they are trustworthy. 


Not all scammers work by scheme: I am just scamming from the start and being quickly caught. More careful ones are firstly play a reliable part and only after that start to scam. So then they have "alibi" - see we did something good we can't be bad. And it works.

And yes, I am aware that not everyone who call themselves "Ukrainian" are indeed Ukrainian. And there are a lot of fakes online. (Maybe I will write another thread about fakes).

5. Mriya. A lot can be written here. But first of all. Show me where Ukrainians asked Mriya to create 24/7 bullshit space under the pretext of support. Show me where Ukrainians agreed for Mriya to talk instead of Ukrainians and decide for Ukrainians.

And if they support should they listen to Ukrainians? Are the hosts Ukrainians? How often are there Ukrainians (especially not compromised corrupted ones)?

But instead we see mass blocking of Ukrainians by MriyaR (at this point numbers are already few hundreds at least). We see regular hosting of absolutely non pro Ukrainian people and russian propaganda. We see western entitled experts and hosts "who know better".

I mean, you obviously can do that. But then FFS name yourself "Canadian russian association for peace" or something like that instead of appropriating Ukrainian word for your name and Ukrainian symbol for your logo. And instead of pushing that as pro-Ukrainian.

We don't need some westerns to decide for us. And we definitely don't need something like "Belo-russia" opposition (same oxymoron as russian one) to be hosted and allowed to spew bullshit that Ukraine is to blame for lukashenko. While positioning that as pro-Ukraine.

We don't need some pos westerners to wrongly teach people how to spell Kiev instead of Kyiv. And if you think you have the right to do that and spread such bullshit and russian propaganda as pro-Ukrainian - GFY.


6. "You shouldn't criticize them as they are pro-Ukrainian" - GFY. It's up to me as Ukrainian and other Ukrainians to see if we are indeed supported or not. And then decide if something is wrong and needs to be criticized. And GFY if you want to shut me up.

If you fucking don't know - Ukrainians are not the ones to stay silent. We speak and we fight. We do revolution if someone wants to enslave and oppress us! And if you are offended that Ukrainians are don't agree to be silent and oppressed during genocide - GFY

If your support only holds on your feeling of being a savior and you threat and critic as offense - GFY. No one needs such supporters. And definitely not needed for Ukrainians during genocide.

7. Harassing, attacking, silencing of Ukrainians. Happens a lot these days. Especially, from so-called "supporters".
"You sound like DAO". Means I don't like what you said so I just generalize and put you in the group you never belonged, so I can dismiss you.

GFY with your generalising. No one needs such shit as a supporter. No one needs your tone policing and silencing.

"If you think" means I don't care about your opinion and dismiss it because I am a westerner and I know better. GFY along with the previous one. I know what I am talking about. And I don't need you to decide if someone is pro-Ukraine or not FFS.

Means, it's okay for westerns to regularly fuck up and offend Ukrainians. You shouldn't criticize. Just stay silent because we are here supporting you. And we know better what support that needs to be. And obviously we will block you immediately instead. GFY.

"People are fed up" so what? I need to stay silent? Is that a threat? Otherwise what? You stop support? Harass and attack me? Report? By that happens every day. And I am not afraid. GFY! Especially since I never was part of DAO.

Fake lists containing a lot of Ukrainians and calling them n-zi is also totally ok these days. And being endorsed by great supporting MR. GFY. Fucking POS. 

"Why are you not dying in trenches?" It's often sent to Ukrainians not only abroad. GFY!

So as a short summary. If you want to dismiss, silence, harass Ukrainians - you can do that. And many under disguise of being in NAFO already doing that. But don't expect that we will be silent and grateful for your "support". I have enough of GFY in my stash left.

So I can send them to you daily. And again, I don't fear. And I don't care. I know where I am from and russian propaganda is. I know what justification of genocide is from so-called "supporters".

But, I also want to send a message to true supporters. Who indeed listens instead of tone policing. Thank you for your support. Thank you for your donations to reputable charities in Ukraine. But please, don't allow bad actors to smear your efforts and discredit you.

Their bullshit shouldn't be louder than your words and support. Their attacks on reputable Ukrainian charities like CBA shouldn't be ignored. 

Good wishes from Kyiv (but not to pos like jjsmart, MR, Maya, Jarvis, ghÑŽst,feyd, etc). 

End of a ðŸ§µ.
